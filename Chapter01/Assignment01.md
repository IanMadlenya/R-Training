# Assignment 01 for R-Training Project

This assignment surves as your very first step into the R world. You will know what kind of development environments you can work in with the R Programming Language, the appearance of the language itself and how it has evolved, and the proliferate and supportive community that makes R a widely accepted necessity for data-oriented problems.

## RGUI

1. Download and install the latest version of R from CRAN. What's new in the latest version compared to the former one? Who contribute to make such changes? How did they manage to make those advances in your opinion? Although most of the improvement might not seem to make sense for you for the moment, choose one that looks most appealing and get familiar with the issues involved and decide how importance it is.

2. Locate and run the `RGUI` program from the start-up menu, or `\bin\x64` or `\bin\i386` in your installing folder. Type in RGUI console whatever statements that you deem reasonable and test whether R recognizes your instructions. If you know some other programming languages, try a variety of expressions, see how RGUI responds to them, and discuss how the syntax of R differs and has in common.

## RStudio

1. Download, install and launch the latest version of RStudio from RStudio.com. Go to `Tools` `Global Options` `Appearance` and choose your favorite editor theme for your coding experience in R. 

2. Get familiar with the user interface. For What (programming) languages does the text editor provide intrinsic support in terms of highlighting(e.g. type `function` or `for` in the text editor for an R source file and these *keyword* will be highlighted)? For what (programming) languages does the text editor provide auto-completion(e.g. type `sys` and press `Tab`)? How do the text editor and the `Console` interact with each other?

3. Get to know the functionality of each menu strip, toolbox, and buttons, especially of `Run` and `Source` buttons above the text editor. What's the difference between these two buttons? Take a look at the `Package` tab in the bottom-right panel, find `stats`, enter several entries in the package, and test the sample code in the `Examples` section in corresponding `Help` pages. Imagine cases in which each function in the package might be used.

4. Find in `RStudio Docs` in `Help` menu how to debug an R program by setting break points and try.

## The R Programming Language

1. Go to wikipedia and search the entry `R Programming Language`. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in what programming languages? Make some guess on what that means. What statistical features of the R programming language are described? What's the relationship between the R programming language and other programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, Python, and those in the .NET family?

2. Follow the examples one by one either in RGUI or in RStudio. In each example, the result of which statements can be easily predicted? Which statement brings surprising result to you? From these examples, how do you define a variable? How do you define a function? What kind of objects, such as vector and matrix, are involved in the examples? Are functions objects in the R programming language? Why or why not? Can you pass a function as an argument to another function? Refer to `Help` for those statement that don't seem to make sense to you.

3. Go to the wikipedia pages of C, C++, Java, C#, Python, MATLAB, SPSS, SAS and other programming languages or environments that you know, take note of the differnt `programming paradigms` each of them supports, and try to make sense of each of the `programming paradigms`, such as `functional`, `object-oriented` and `array`, by carefully comparing the introductions and code examples. 

## The R Community

1. Go to `CRAN` and see what it does.

2. Go to `stackoverflow` and see how people collaborate to solve problems.

3. Go to `Github` and see how `social coding` is carried out for R projects.

4. Go to `R-Bloggers` and `Capital of Statistics` and carefully read several latest articals. What do the authers talk about? How do they investigate the problem using the R programming language? What difficulties do they meet during the process?

## Packages

In the `Package` section in wikipedia page of `R Programming Language`, which page on the CRAN website is described to list a wide range of tasks? Go to that page after you name some of the fields that you are most familiar with, such as Finance and Econometrics, and find one of the related packages that you think what it does. Install and load the package in RStudio, and try examples in the package help pages.
