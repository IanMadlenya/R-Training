# Chapter 1. Introduction to R
Saturday, September 27, 2014  

> R is, at its heart, an elegant and beautiful language, well tailored for data analysis and statistics. --- Hadley Wickham

For introduction of R language, you are recommended to read the [first chapter of R in Action](http://www.manning.com/kabacoff/) and the [introduction part of Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html).


## R Installation

### Install R

You can follow my [instruction][install] which is described below to install and upgrade R on Windows.

First, you need to download  [R][] and [RStudio][] and install them. After the installations, run the following codes to set up a global library.


```r
chooseCRANmirror() # Choose XMU
source("http://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/upgrading-R-on-windows.r.txt")
Old.R.RunMe()
```

### Upgrade R

Once you have done these, from now on, whenever you want to update to a new version of R in the future, all you will need to do are the following **TWO** steps:

1. Download and install the new version of R
2. Open your new R and run the following codes


```r
source("http://www.r-statistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/upgrading-R-on-windows.r.txt")
New.R.RunMe()
```


### RStudio settings

Open up your RStudio. In RStudio, Tools --> Global Options --> Code Editing/Appearance. See [Customizing RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200549016-Customizing-RStudio) for details.

Most used RStudio keyboard shortcuts:

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts) for more details.



## Getting help

Use `Ctrl+Enter` to run the selected codes or the line where you cursor on. The output is shown in the `Console` window.


```r
help.start()   # general help
help(plot)      # help about function plot
?plot          # same thing 
apropos("plot") # list all functions containing string plot
example(plot)   # show an example of function plot

# search for plot in help manuals and archived mailing lists
RSiteSearch("plot")

# get vignettes on using installed packages
vignette()      # show available vingettes
vignette("knitr-html") # show specific vignette
```


## Manage your workspace

Now please create a file in you computer system as your workpalce. Such as `E:\Project\WISE R Club\LearnR`.

R gets confused if you use a path in your code like
```
c:\mydocuments\myfile.txt
```

This is because R sees "\" as an escape character. 

Instead, you should use 
```
c:\\my documents\\myfile.txt
c:/mydocuments/myfile.txt
```
Either will work.



```r
getwd() # print the current working directory - cwd 
ls()    # list the objects in the current workspace

setwd("E:/Project/WISE R Club/LearnR")  # note / instead of \ in windows 

# view and set options for the session
help(options) # learn about available options
options() # view current option settings
optio#ns(digits=3) # number of digits to print on output

# work with your previous commands
history() # display last 25 commands
history(max.show=Inf) # display all previous commands

# save your command history 
savehistory(file="myfile") # default is ".Rhistory" 

# recall your command history 
loadhistory(file="myfile") # default is ".Rhistory"

# save the workspace to the file .RData in the cwd 
save.image()

# save specific objects to a file
# if you don't specify the path, the cwd is assumed 
save(object list, file="myfile.RData")
save(x, file="mydata.RData")

# load a workspace into the current session
# if you don't specify the path, the cwd is assumed 
load("mydata.RData")

q() # quit R. You will be prompted to save the workspace.
```


## Script input/output

By default, R provides an interactive session with input from the keyboard and output to the screen. However, you can have input come from a script file and direct output to a variety of destinations.

### Input


```r
# source a script
source("myfile.R")
source("myfile.R", print.eval = TRUE)
source("myfile.R", echo = TRUE, print.eval = TRUE)
```

### Output

The `sink( )` function defines how to print the output.


```r
# direct output to a file 
sink("output_file", append=FALSE, split=FALSE)

# return output to the terminal 
sink()
```

The `append` option controls whether output overwrites or adds to a file. The split option determines if output is also sent to the screen as well as the output file.

Here are some examples of the sink() function.


```r
# output directed to myfile.txt in cwd. output is appended to existing file. output also send to terminal. 
sink("output_file.txt", append=FALSE)
x <- 1:5
cat("x: \n")
x
cat("Mean: \n")
mean(x)
cat("Variance: \n")
var(x)

cat("\n")
source("myfile.R", echo = TRUE, print.eval = TRUE)

sink()
```

When redirecting output, use the `cat( )` function to annotate the output.

## Packages
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library.


```r
.libPaths() # get library location 
library()   # see all packages installed 
search()    # see packages currently loaded
```

A complete [list of contributed packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) is available from CRAN. 

You can add packages from the `Tools --> Install Packages` or run code like `install.packages("ggplot2")`. You can update packages from `Tools --> Check for Packages Updates` or use `update.packages()`

## Reusing results

One of the most useful design features of R is that the output of analyses can easily be saved and used as input to additional analyses.  Please see the following examples.


```r
lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)

fit <- lm(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)

str(fit) # view the contents/structure of "fit"

# plot residuals by fitted values
plot(fit$residuals, fit$fitted.values)

# produce diagnostic plots
plot(fit) 
```

## An example

An example at the end.


```r
setwd("E:/Project/WISE R Club/LearnR")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
help(package = "ggplot2")
vignette(package = "ggplot2")
?qplot
str(diamonds)
example(qplot) # example of qplot function
qplot(color, price/carat, data = diamonds, geom="jitter", alpha = I(1/5))
```

Notices: R is a case sensitive language.
