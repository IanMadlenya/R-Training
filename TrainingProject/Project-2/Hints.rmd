Hints for dataGrab
========================================================

1. Remind that not every day is a trading day. Try to see what we can grab when the given date is not a trading day, and find a proper way to deal with this issue.

2. Package RSQLite and RODBC might be used to connect with a database, and write data into it.

3. Try to create a log file when you are grabbing historical data. 

4. Notice there might be some very tricky situations making your program break. More hints about these details will be given if they are needed.
